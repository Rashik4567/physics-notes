# Distance
Distance is the total length travelled by an object. It does not take direction into account.
Distance is a measurement of length.

- **Properties of Distance**:
	Type: Scaler quantity
	Dimension: L
	Si Unit: m (Meter)


- **Formulas**:
	$d=\Sigma s$  [where s1, s2, s3, ... , s are the paths travelled by a body.]
	


# Displacement
Displacement is the numerical measurement of the **shortest distance** of a travelling bodies starting position and final position. Most of the time displacement is the **straight line** between the staring point and the final point. 
Displacement is a measurement of length.
**Displacement is typically represented as 's' in mathematical equations.**

- **Properties of Displacement:**
	Type: Vector quantity
	Dimension: L
	Si unit: m (Meter)

- **Formulas:**
	$s=\sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2}$ 
	[For 2 points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2) in 2 dimensional space]
	[This formula can be extended to the number of dimensions]
	Such as, for 3 dimensions (x, y, z):
	$s=\sqrt{\Delta x^2 + \Delta y^2 + \Delta z^2}$ 

# Speed
Speed is the rate of change of an objects distance with respect to time. Speed does not change with directional changes, speed only changes if the rate of change of distance changes.

- **Properties of Speed**:
	Type: Scaler quantity
	Dimension: $LT^-1$
	Si Unit: $ms^{-1}$


- **Formulas:**
	speed $s=\frac{d}{dt} (distance)$ 
	$s=\frac{\Delta distance}{time}$ time= time required to cross that distance.

# Velocity
Velocity is the rate of change of an objects distance in a certain direction (displacement) with respect to time. Velocity depends on both the numerical value of displacement and the direction. A change in direction of displacement causes a change in velocity.
**Velocity is typically represented as 'v' in mathematical equations.**

- **Properties of Velocity**:
	Type: Vector quantity
	Dimension: $LT^-1$
	Si Unit: $ms^-1$


- **Formulas**:
	Velocity $v=\frac{d}{dt}(displacement)=\frac{s}{t}$


# Acceleration
Acceleration is the rate of change of velocity of an object over time.
**Acceleration is typically represented as 'a' in mathematical equations.**

- **Properties of Velocity:**
	Type: Vector quantity
	Dimension: $LT^-2$
	Si Unit: $ms^-2$


- **Formulas**:
	Acceleration $a=\frac{d}{dt}(v)=\frac{d^{2}}{d^{2}t}(s)$


Formulas for liner motion:
- **Notation:** 
		$\overrightarrow{s}$ → Displacement or distance in a certain direction
		$\overrightarrow{v}$ → Velocity
		$\overrightarrow{a}$ → Acceleration
		$t$ → time or delta time
		The sign before $a$ will change depending on the direction of acceleration

- **Main**:
		1. $s=vt$
		2. $v=u \pm at$
		3. $v^{2}=u^{2}\pm2as$
		4. $s=ut\pm\frac{1}{2}at^{2}$

- **Shortcuts:**
		1. $s=u\pm\frac{1}{2}a(2t-1)$ 


# Gravitational Motion
Motion due to gravity.

**Galileo’s falling bodies:**
1. Any freefalling object released from the same falls the same amount of height in the same amount of time. Mass of a body does not affect gravitational motion.
2. Velocity of a freefalling body is directly proportional to the time (passed from release).$$
v\propto t
$$
3. Height crossed by a freefalling body is directly proportional to the square of the time (passed from release).$$
h\propto t^{2}
$$

Formulas for liner motion can be used to describe gravitational motion too. Replacing ‘a’ with ‘g’, ‘s’ with ‘h’ will give us the formulas below:

Formulas for gravitational motion:
- **Notation**:
		$\overrightarrow{h}$ → height crossed since release
		g → acceleration due to gravity/gravitational acceleration. $g=9.8 ms ^{-2}$
		[Rest are the same as liner motion]
		The sign before g will change depending on if the object is released from above(g → positive) or if the object is thrown straight up(g → negative).
- **Formulas:**
		1. $h=gt$
		2. $v=u\pm gt$
		3. $v^{2}=u^{2}\pm gh$
		4. $h=ut\pm \frac{1}{2}gt^{2}$
- **Shortcuts:**
		1. Maximum height of an object thrown directly upwards: $H=\frac{u^{2}}{2g}$
		2.
